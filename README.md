## Points covered
- [x] Basic React - Making shared components and building a few pages.
- [x] Styling and layout
     - Adding UI library such as Tailwind and font-awesome.

    - Also add individual layouts to your pages to understand the concept of HOCs and layouts better.

- [x] App Routing and navigation - Setting up routes in the application to include the following scenarios:
    - Basic routing, e.g. "/"
    - Nested routing, e.g. "/companies/[company]/"
    - Dynamic routing, e.g. "/companies/[company]/employees/[id]".
